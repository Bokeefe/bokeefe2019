      <p>
        My tech interests are centered around the various ways
        that we can use the web to bring people together.
        I believe that by focusing on solid web technologies people
        can lessen their ecological footprint, require less bureaucracy,
        connect with similar minds, and collaborate more.
        <br><br>
        I hope to find a workplace where I can contribute my work ethic,
        inquisitive spirit, and problem solving skills to an exciting and
        collaborative team. Having worked for a small start up with 200
        customers as well as a large company that serves millions I have
        learned a lot about successful work environments. I would like my
        next job to fall somewhere between my last two jobs and find a
        workplace with a great mixture of challenges and a positive spirit.

        <p>Charter recently became a large company with a customer base of about 30 million people. I work at the Denver campus with 3,000 other employees on a team of 7. We have been tasked with creating a number of apps that seek to integrate thousands of legacy customers from older companies acquired by Charter.
          <br><br>
          It has been a great experience working with professional architecture, design, accessibility and testing teams to deliver websites that millions of people can use easily. Front-end teams at Charter share their own libraries in order to meet ADA and brand criteria and I have had my hand in contributing to those projects as well as troubleshooting them. Collaborating with other teams has been a great opportunity to learn from different practices and problem-solving approaches. My work here has been in Angular (7 & 8) with one small application in React and mocking databases in Node.</p>

        <p>Day-to-day I worked on a team of 6 other developers
          on our flagship software ServiceCore. This application handles the accounting, syncing with QuickBooks,
          scheduling, GPS routing, and reporting of various service businesses in the septic and portable toilet
          industry. The technology stack is angular.js/Angular/Ionic hybrid and php. <br><br>1bg also provides
          contract-based projects as well as hosting for 22 WordPress sites. Clients also have required
          various specialized solutions which led to me writing custom plugins and themes in php/WordPress.The experience I am most proud of at this job has been creating a brand-new cloud platform for a multinational
          client from scratch in Angular 6. I was responsible for developing the entire front-end for
          this application that served millions of records that could be paginated, sorted,
          and filtered efficiently even on mobile devices. It also had the capability to switch
          translations on the front-end by the user. </p>

          This was a short-lived start-up where my position was to create brand content and take on
          all WordPress client work. I worked with clients to wireframe, draft responsive mock-ups in
          Adobe XD, and execute their ideas from scratch. Also, I apprenticed under the lead React.js/Native
          developer on small tickets for a flagship app.

          I was brought in to help this non-profit in developing a platform for their followers to connect.
          Because it needs to remain editable to non-coders, it is an 'appified' WordPress site. My role was
          to use a userâ€™s location and interests and connect them to several APIs, inform users of their
          elected representatives as well as schedule push notifications for events and elections and also
          provide a personally relevant, local political news feed. This required me to create a custom
          theme and to write custom PHP functions that communicate with the MySQL database. I also
          created administrative pages in the dashboard so the app can be managed by non-coders in the
          future.

          Exquisite Warps has been an idea of mine for a long time. It seeks to create a platform for music and storytelling collaboration with friends or strangers. Like the artist's game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse"
             target="_blank"> Exquisite Corpse</a>, it uses mystery, imagination, and collaboration to create something big together.
