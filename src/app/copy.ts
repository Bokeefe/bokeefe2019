      blurb: `Charter recently became a large company with a customer base of about 30 million people.
       I work at the Denver campus with 3,000 other employees on a team of 7. We have been tasked with
       creating a number of apps that seek to integrate thousands of legacy customers from older companies
       acquired by Charter. It has been a great experience working with professional architecture, design,
        accessibility and testing teams to deliver websites that millions of people can use easily.
        Front-end teams at Charter share their own libraries in order to meet ADA and brand criteria
        and I have had my hand in contributing to those projects as well as troubleshooting them.
        Collaborating with other teams has been a great opportunity to learn from different practices
         and problem-solving approaches. My work here has been in Angular (7 & 8) with one small application
          in React and mocking databases in Node.`

      time: `Aug '17 - Nov '18`,

      blurb: `The experience I am most proud of at this job has been creating a brand-new cloud platform for a multinational
      client from scratch in Angular 6. I was responsible for developing the entire front-end for
      this application that served millions of records that could be paginated, sorted,
      and filtered efficiently even on mobile devices. It also had the capability to switch
      translations on the front-end by the user. Day-to-day I worked on a team of 6 other developers
       on our flagship software ServiceCore. This application handles the accounting, syncing with QuickBooks,
       scheduling, GPS routing, and reporting of various service businesses in the septic and portable toilet
        industry. The technology stack is angular.js/Angular/Ionic hybrid and php. 1bg also provides
         contract-based projects as well as hosting for 22 WordPress sites. Clients also have required
          various specialized solutions which led to me writing custom plugins and themes in php/WordPress. `
